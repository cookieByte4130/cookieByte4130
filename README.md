## Background
In the wilderness this lone lass was adopted by a band of TLM misfits who taught her the ways of JS, HTML, CSS. A plague ravaged the land sending her into solitude for a time. After many months waiting for the viral storm to pass, a grand wizard came and teleported her to a foreign land. Resourceful as she was, she quickly accumulated a powerful tool, Macbook, and sought to continue the quest of knowledge she'd started with TLM. She heard of an illustrious group of software engineer mages, NC, and sought alliance with the NC. In her attempts to prove herself worthy of this group, she was introduced to a powerful sorccerer of npm, git, Jest, and Enzyme. He taught her how to display her powers for the world to see. After leveling up her skills learning React and a bit of Redux, she sought to join NC. This time she was successful. She trained with the top coding mages of the land of HR. Day and night she worked to master the arts of Agile workflow, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, deployment, scaling, etc. After months of grueling training she emerged victorious with a greater understanding of how these technologies worked and strategies to learn more quickly. Now she begins the next phase of her journey as she takes these skills into the wild...
